This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project for predicting various diseases using multiple algorithms. 
The project includes a frontend interface for ease of use by healthcare professionals and researchers. 
The models implemented include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XGBoost, and Neural Networks.

# FEATURES
Disease Prediction Models: Implementations of various machine learning models for predicting diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.
Frontend Interface: A user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive predictions.
Data Visualization: Interactive visualizations to help understand the factors affecting disease predictions.
Model Comparison: Tools to compare the performance of different machine learning models.

Start the frontend using: streamlit run app.py

# Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure the datasets are placed in the data directory.
Model Training: Use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to explore the data and train models.
Predictions: Run app.py to start the Streamlit frontend. Input patient data into the interface to receive predictions from the trained models.
